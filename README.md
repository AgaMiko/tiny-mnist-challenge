# TinyMNISTChallenge
Tiny MNIST Challenge for Gda≈Ñsk University student's class.

### Matlab examples - code and toolboxes instruction.
Built-in data loaders and submission preparation.
* Simple neural network - [code]('matlab_examples/simple_Network.m')
A framework for using matlab toolbox to design basic fully-connected network. 

* Basic convolutional neural network - [code]('matlab_examples/simple_CNN.m')
Simple neural network with 2 convolutional layers, relu activation, maxpooling and fully-connected layer.

### Pytorch examples - ready to run in Colab
Built-in data loaders, submission preparation and sending.

* Simple neural network - [code]('pytoch_examples/simple_Network.m')
This is a basic fully-connected network. Two fully-connected layers and relu activation.

* Basic convolutional neural network - [code]('pytorch_examples/simple_CNN.m')
